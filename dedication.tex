The entirety of my academic work and especially this thesis is dedicated to my family and friends. To my friends for the countless good times and midnight conversations. To my brothers, Anthony who never fails to be the ultimate example of hard work and Joe who reminds me that taking time for whatâ€™s most important is just as valuable. To Sara for her unending love and encouragement through any and all stressful times. I have special gratitude for my parents who introduced me to and nurtured my love of the outdoors.  It is because of your love, support, patience, and guidance that I have been able to work and grow in my education and in life. I could never find a better group of people to surround myself with. And finally to God, for creating the wild things and places where I find my passion.
