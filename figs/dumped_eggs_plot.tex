	{Nest boxes with evidence of egg dumping for each pool of the study. Green circles indicate boxes with Hooded Merganser as the host species. Orange triangles indicate boxes with Wood Duck as the host species. Boxes N7 and N65 both had one egg dumped. Boxes S14 and S14 both had two eggs dumped. Box E62 had sequential nesting events, both by Wood Duck. Box S7 had sequential nesting events, first by Hooded Merganser followed by Wood Duck.}
